Every main takes a runNumber as input, and saves a final sample (after training) in a folder based on the run numnber.

Have your model run main in an mnist_ddpm_solution.py file and make it return time_to_train, time_to_generate, fid, IS




Remember to change back before final run:

Training Epochs of models.

Disable reporting.
